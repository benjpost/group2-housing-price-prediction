## Team Workflow Process

### Project KanBan Board

Be sure to create tasks for the team to complete. Update the tasks as well, when appropriate.

### Coding on new branches

Every pair/programming session should conduct the following process to ensure that you do not create `git` conflicts:

1. Create new branch with a meaningful, goal-driven name.
2. Switch to the new branch.
    - ***WARNING***: Be sure to make this switch!
3. Work on code / content.
4. After completing the goal, `commit` and `push` changes made on new branch.
5. Create a `pull request` and ...
    - Write an overview of your new changes/additions for your other team members to review. You can use a bulleted list to do so.
    - Tag/request your peers to review it.
6. Team members should review it in a timely manner and use the discussion features to coordinate their thoughts and ideas.
7. Once everyone thinks the changes are good, `merge` changes to main branch
